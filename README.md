<p align="center">FaDeRS: Fairness and Depolarization in Recommender Systems</p>

## :page_with_curl: About the project <a name="-sobre"/></a>

Context: Recommender systems have become fundamental in modern society as they help navigate the vast amount of available data, enabling users to find information, products, or services more efficiently and personally. They directly impact how people consume data, goods, and resources. Problem: Recommender systems often lack fairness and diversity, resulting in unfair services and increased preference polarization. Solution: This work presents FaDeRS (Fairness and Depolarization in Recommender Systems), an approach aimed at increasing fairness and diversity in recommender systems. FaDeRS adjusts predictions through controlled perturbations and optimization to mitigate individual unfairness and polarization without modifying the input data. IS Theory: The research is related to socio-technical theory, addressing one of the socio-algorithmic problems, algorithmic discrimination. We consider a specific set of approaches to encode fair behaviors. Method: The research applied a quantitative method with experimentation using two datasets in distinct contexts, implementing a post-processing algorithm based on the Simulated Annealing meta-heuristic. Summary of Results: The proposed framework demonstrated significant reductions in polarization (up to 78.64\%) and individual unfairness (up to 33.97\%), with only a small increase in the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), indicating an improvement in the socially desirable qualities of the systems without unduly sacrificing accuracy. Contributions and Impact in the IS field: The main contribution is a mechanism that balances personalization and fairness, simultaneously addressing polarization and individual unfairness from the items' perspective, promoting a fairer and more diverse approach to recommendation.

* **Polarization**: To capture polarization, we seek to measure the extent to which user ratings disagree. Thus, to measure user polarization, we consider the estimated ratings `$\hat{X}$`, and define the polarization metric as the normalized sum of the Euclidean distances between pairs of estimated user ratings, that is, between rows of `$\hat{X}$`.

* **Individual fairness**: For each item `$j$`, we define `$\ell_j$`, the loss of item `$j$`, as the mean squared error of the estimate over the known ratings of item `$j$`.
